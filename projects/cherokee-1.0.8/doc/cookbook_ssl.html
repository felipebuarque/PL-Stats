It is embeddable and extensible with plug-ins. It supports on-the-fly configuration by reading files or strings, TLS/SSL (via GNUTLS or OpenSSL), virtual hosts, authentication, cache friendly features, PHP, custom error management, and much more." />

<div class="paragraph"><p>This section answers some general questions and details the procedure
to generate SSL keys.</p></div>
<h3 id="general">General questions</h3><div style="clear:left"></div>
<div class="paragraph"><div class="title">Can the same server provide HTTP and HTTPS?</div><p>Yes. HTTP and HTTPS use different server ports. The former binds to
port 80 and the latter to port 443, so there is no conflict between
them. To provide HTTPS you will need matching certificates.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Keep in mind that to have one of your virtual servers with HTTPS
enabled you will need to configure HTTPS settings for all of them.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><div class="title">Which port does HTTPS use?</div><p>HTTPS can run on any port, but the standards specify port 443. That&#8217;s
where any HTTPS compliant browser will look by default. You can change
that by specifying another port in the URL. For example,
<a href="https://example.com:8080/">https://example.com:8080/</a> would look for an HTTPS server on port 8080.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><div class="title">How to enable the SSL support?</div><p>SSL support is not enabled by default. You will have to perform three
straightforward actions is order to enable it:</p></div>
<div class="olist arabic"><ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>
The first step is to enable a TLS/SSL engine. The option is
    located in the <a href="config_general.html">General</a> configuration
    setting. Cherokee is shipped with a libssl plug-in.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Once the engine is configured, a new
    <a href="config_general.html#ports_to_listen">binding port</a> must be
    configured.  By default, HTTPS uses the port 443. Remember to add
    this port, and to check the TLS toggle button.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
The last step would be to assign SSL certificates to the virtual
    servers, starting with the default virtual server.  Cherokee uses
    SNI to distinguish between virtual servers. The certificate
    specified in the default server will be used in the first
    negotiation. If not present, the startup sequence will fail. The
    configuration is found inside each
    <a href="config_virtual_servers.html#security">virtual server</a>
    configuration, under the Security tab. This part is <em>very
    important</em>: you have to concatenate your certificates into a
    single file in order to use them in Cherokee.
</p>
</li>
</ol></div>
<div class="paragraph"><div class="title">How to manually test HTTP/HTTPS?</div><p>HTTP can easily be tested like this:</p></div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre><tt>$ telnet localhost 80
 GET / HTTP/1.0</tt></pre>
</div></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>For HTTPS it is not so easy because of the SSL protocol between TCP
and HTTP. However you can do a similar check with the help of
OpenSSL&#8217;s s_client command.</p></div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre><tt>$ openssl s_client -connect localhost:443 -state -debug
 GET / HTTP/1.0</tt></pre>
</div></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>You will receive detailed information about the SSL handshake before
the actual HTTP response.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>A more general command line client is probably a better choice.
<a href="http://curl.haxx.se/">cURL</a> deals with both HTTP and HTTPS, and
performs a bunch of other interesting stuff.</p></div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre><tt>$ curl http://localhost/
$ curl https://localhost/</tt></pre>
</div></div>
<h3 id="overview">Private keys and Certificates overview</h3><div style="clear:left"></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>First some terminology:</p></div>
<div class="olist arabic"><ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>
RSA private key file: a digital file that can be used to decrypt
  messages sent to you. It has a public component that must be
  distributed (via your Certificate file) to allow people to encrypt
  those messages.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
CSR, or Certificate Signing Request: a digital file containing your
  public key and your name. It is sent to a Certifying Authority (CA)
  that will convert sign it to convert it into a real Certificate.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Certificate: contains your RSA public key and name, the name of the
  CA, and is digitally signed by the CA. A browser that knows the CA
  can verify the signature and obtain your RSA public key, which can
  be used to send messages which only you can decrypt.
</p>
</li>
</ol></div>
<div class="paragraph"><div class="title">Does the startup between a non-SSL and an SSL-aware web server differ?</div><p>Yes. Although in essence it is exactly the same, if you have a
passphrase on your SSL private key file, a startup dialog will asks
you to enter it. This can be problematic if the web server needs to be
started automatically. In this case, the <a href="#passphrase">passphrase</a>
can be removed from your private key at the cost of erasing a security
layer, which brings additional security risks.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><div class="title">Does Cherokee offer any help for Certificate Generation?</div><p>Yes. A script is provided to assist you with Certificate Generation.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Just locate the <tt>contrib</tt> subdirectory and type:</p></div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre><tt>make-cert.sh</tt></pre>
</div></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>And follow the instructions. It will generate the required files, but
you will have to install them manually.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>It has been tested and has worked fine every time, but if you don&#8217;t find
the script or it doesn&#8217;t work for you can always follow the rest of
the procedure described in this recipe to manually generate the
certificates.</p></div>
<h3 id="locate">Locate CA.pl or CA.sh</h3><div style="clear:left"></div>
<div class="ulist"><ul>
<li>
<p>
On Debian or Ubuntu those are usually located under /usr/lib/ssl/misc/
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
On MacOS X, you will find them in /System/Library/OpenSSL/misc/
</p>

openssl req -days 1000 -new -x509 -nodes -out $CERTNAME -keyout $CERTNAME
chmod 600 $CERTNAME
openssl verify $CERTNAME
if [ $? != 0 ]; then
    \mv $CERTNAME $CERTNAME.not_valid

</div></div>

<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre><tt>$ openssl req -new -x509 -nodes -out server.crt -keyout server.key</tt></pre>
</div></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Which would produce a couple of files: the SSL Certificate File
(server.crt) and the SSL Certificate key file (server.key).</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>This server.key does not have any passphrase. To add a passphrase to
the key, you should run the following command, and enter &amp; verify the
passphrase as requested.</p></div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre><tt>$ openssl rsa -des3 -in server.key -out server.key.new
$ mv server.key.new server.key</tt></pre>

<div class="paragraph"><p>You should probably backup the key file and the entered passphrase in
a secure location.</p></div>
<h3 id="passphrase">Pass-phrase issues</h3><div style="clear:left"></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>As noted above, if you have a pass-phrase on your SSL private key file,
the web-server start up will remain on hold until you enter it. Here
is the information needed to change it or even remove it, but bare in
mind the security implications.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><div class="title">How to change the pass-phrase on a private key file?</div><p>Simply read it with the old pass-phrase and write it again, specifying
a new pass-phrase.  This can be done withe these commands:</p></div>

<div class="content">
<pre><tt>$ openssl rsa -des3 -in server.key -out server.key.new
$ mv server.key.new server.key</tt></pre>
</div></div>
<div class="paragraph"><div class="title">How to get rid of the pass-phrase?</div><p>The RSA private key inside the server.key file is stored in encrypted
format for security reasons. The pass-phrase is needed to decrypt this
file, so it can be read and parsed. Thus, removing it removes a layer
of security from the web server. It is advised to keep a backup copy
of the original file before proceeding.</p></div>
<div class="listingblock">
