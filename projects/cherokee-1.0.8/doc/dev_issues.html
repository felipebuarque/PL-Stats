It is embeddable and extensible with plug-ins. It supports on-the-fly configuration by reading files or strings, TLS/SSL (via GNUTLS or OpenSSL), virtual hosts, authentication, cache friendly features, PHP, custom error management, and much more." />

<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph"><p>This section of the documentation comprehends a variety of topics. It
is mainly intended as a repository of notes, tips, issues and
documentation concerning parts of Cherokee that are currently under
development -or are full developed- but are not yet included for
mainstream usage.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>As these features get properly integrated into the Cherokee
infrastructure, the notes regarding the subject should be moved to
their specific section of the documentation.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>For now, this document maintains a list of currently open issues. It
mostly is useful to list things of the Cherokee Project that are known
to be half-baked, and as such are only of interest for developers.</p></div>
<h3 id="fastcgi">FastCGI Handler</h3><div style="clear:left"></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>There are two handlers currently implementing the FastCGI protocol:
"fcgi" and "fastcgi".</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The "fastcgi" module also implements the FastCGI protocol. It is a
more complete implementation than "fcgi" although it is also more
complex. Actually, fcgi became the standard choice because the PHP
interpreter is kind of buggy when it has to demultiplex multiple
requests from the same socket. As such, it is the only one supported
by Cherokee-Admin.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The "fastcgi" handler will eventually become the default option
because it is faster and more standard-compliant. However, at the
moment "fcgi" is a better option.</p></div>
